# Challenges
These folders each contain one challenge that will try to improve my skills at programming. These ones I got from http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/.

To further challenge myself I might be doing it in three different languages, Python, Java and C++. All of them have separate folders in each challenge folder.

You are free to try them out yourself but this is mainly for me to see what I can do.
